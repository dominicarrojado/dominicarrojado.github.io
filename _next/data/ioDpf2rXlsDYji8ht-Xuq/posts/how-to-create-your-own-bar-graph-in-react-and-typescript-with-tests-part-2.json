Check out the guide for `faker` [here](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/).\n\n---\n\n## Write tests for BarItem component\n\nBefore we go ahead with creating the test file for the `BarItem` component, let's first add the `data-testid` attributes to help us [query](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about) the elements in the component later. Open `src/components/BarItem.tsx` and update the code with the following:\n\n```tsx\n...\nexport default function BarItem(props: Props) {\n  return (\n    <div\n      className={cn('bar-item', { 'is-negative': props.isNegative })}\n      data-testid=\"bar-item\"\n    >\n      <div\n        ...\n        data-testid=\"bar-item-main\"\n      />\n      <div\n        ...\n        data-testid=\"bar-item-offset\"\n      />\n      <div className=\"bar-item-legend\" data-testid=\"bar-item-legend\">\n        {props.legend}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nAlright, we're ready to start writing some tests. For test files, I like to separate them in a folder so that it's less cluttered when viewing the main files. Create a new folder named `__tests__` under the `src/components` folder. This is where we will put the test files for the components we have. For our first test case, we can start with the `BarItem` component. Create a file under the `src/components/__tests__` folder and name it `BarItem.test.tsx`. The path for this new file should be `src/components/__tests__/BarItem.test.tsx`. This is a common naming convention for test files, make sure it matches the file name that you are testing then add infix `.test` for the test file name.\n\n---\n\nNow let's add in the initial structure of the test file:\n\n```tsx\nimport BarItem, { Props } from '../BarItem';\n\ndescribe('BarItem component', () => {});\n```\n\nAside from importing the component that we will test, we also imported the type `Props`. You'll get to know why we did that later on.\n\nIn your test files, Jest puts [functions and objects](https://jestjs.io/docs/api) into the global environment. [`describe`](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#describename-fn) is one of the functions available globally, so with the setup of Create React App, we don't need to require or import anything to use them. `describe` creates a block that groups together several related tests. So ideally the description should be explaining what we are testing, so this is why I put `'BarItem component'`. Feel free to rename the description according to your preference if you feel that there's a better description of what we are testing.\n\nNext we can add a test case inside the `describe` block:\n\n```tsx\nimport BarItem, { Props } from '../BarItem';\n\ndescribe('BarItem component', () => {\n  it('should render a bar with positive values', () => {});\n});\n```\n\nThe [`it`](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#testname-fn-timeout) (or `test`) method is another global function by Jest that runs a test.\n\n---\n\nLet's start to write some code for the first test case. First, you want to create a reusable function called `renderComponent` inside the `describe` block, it should accept the props (or properties) of our component as an argument and call the `render()` method from Testing Library to render our component with the passed props in a test environment.\n\n```tsx\nimport { render } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport BarItem, { Props } from '../BarItem';\n\ndescribe('<BarItem />', () => {\n  const renderComponent = (props: Props) => render(<BarItem {...props} />);\n\n  it('should render a bar with positive values', () => {});\n});\n```\n\nSince we'll have more than one test case for this component, creating a reusable function to render the component will reduce the code duplication. This will also make it easier if ever next time you have to rename your component, we can just change it within these lines and not in multiple separate lines.\n\nBefore we can render our component using the reusable function, we need to provide the required props for it. This is where we can use `faker` to generate random data for us. This makes our test more trustable and reliable instead of hardcoding the values.\n\nHere's the code we need to add inside our first test case in `src/components/__tests__/BarItem.test.tsx`:\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarItem />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should render a bar with positive values', () => {\n    const legend = faker.lorem.sentence();\n    const barPercent = faker.datatype.number({ min: 0, max: 100 });\n    const barPercentage = `${barPercent}%`;\n    const risePercent = faker.datatype.number({ min: 0, max: barPercent });\n    const risePercentage = `${risePercent}%`;\n\n    renderComponent({\n      legend,\n      barPercentage,\n      risePercentage,\n      isNegative: false,\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n---\n\nSo now that our component has been rendered, we need to verify if the props we passed have been received from the component and render the component as expected. To do that, let's first query for our main element which is the `bar-item`. It is advisable to use [`screen`](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/#screen) methods from the Testing Library, and in our case we can use `.queryByTestId('bar-item')`, which returns the `bar-item` element based on its `data-testid` attribute. To learn more about queries in the Testing Library, you can read more about them [here](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about).\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarItem />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should render a bar with positive values', () => {\n    ...\n\n    renderComponent({\n      ...\n    });\n\n    const barItemEl = screen.queryByTestId('bar-item');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nNow that we have the element, what do we do with it? We can do the checks by executing one of Jest's global functions called the `expect()` method and pass the element returned from our query. Next is to run what we call a matcher method `.toHaveClass()` which checks if the [`class`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class) attribute value of the element is equal to the argument passed. This is one of the matcher methods provided by Jest. You can check this [documentation](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#custom-matchers) for the other custom matcher methods which are specific to the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction).\n\nRemember that in our props, we are passing the value for `isNegative` as `false`. Hence, we do not expect our `bar-item` element to have the `is-negative` in the class. We can use the `.not.toHaveClass()` instead which is the reverse check of `.toHaveClass()`. Here's the code we need to add in our test case:\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarItem />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should render a bar with positive values', () => {\n    ...\n    const barItemEl = screen.queryByTestId('bar-item');\n\n    expect(barItemEl).not.toHaveClass('is-negative');\n  });\n});\n```\n\n---\n\nNow save your changes and let's verify if this test case will pass or not. In your terminal, run the script command available in `package.json` to run the tests:\n\n```bash\nyarn test --coverage\n```\n\nThe `--coverage` parameter will show you how many percent you have covered in each file of your project and/or if you have missed any lines to test. Once the command ran successfully, the terminal should display something like this:\n\n![Screenshot of incomplete test coverage for BarItem component](/images/posts/how-to-create-your-own-bar-graph-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/bar-item-component-test-coverage-incomplete.png)\n\nAlright our very first test case passed! We easily achieved 100% test coverage because there's no conditional statements in the component. Let's complete this test case by adding the rest of the checks:\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarItem />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should render a bar with positive values', () => {\n    ...\n    const barItemEl = screen.queryByTestId('bar-item');\n    const barMainEl = screen.queryByTestId('bar-item-main');\n    const barOffsetEl = screen.queryByTestId('bar-item-offset');\n    const barLegendEl = screen.queryByTestId('bar-item-legend');\n\n    expect(barItemEl).not.toHaveClass('is-negative');\n    expect(barMainEl).toHaveStyle({ height: barPercentage });\n    expect(barOffsetEl).toHaveStyle({ height: risePercentage });\n    expect(barLegendEl).toHaveTextContent(legend);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nOnce the changes are saved, it should still pass. We've completed all the necessary checks based on the props we're passing. Let's move on to the next test case.\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarItem />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should render a bar with negative values', () => {});\n});\n```\n\nIn the code above, I gave you the description of the second test case. As a challenge, add the codes that should be inside the second test case block and compare your code with the expected code later. The tip here is that it would be **_very_** similar to the first case.\n\n---\n\nDone? Alright. Here's the the expected code:\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarItem />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should render a bar with negative values', () => {\n    const legend = faker.lorem.sentence();\n    const barPercent = faker.datatype.number({ min: 0, max: 100 });\n    const barPercentage = `${barPercent}%`;\n    const risePercent = faker.datatype.number({ min: 0, max: barPercent });\n    const risePercentage = `${risePercent}%`;\n\n    renderComponent({\n      legend,\n      barPercentage,\n      risePercentage,\n      isNegative: true,\n    });\n\n    const barItemEl = screen.queryByTestId('bar-item');\n    const barMainEl = screen.queryByTestId('bar-item-main');\n    const barOffsetEl = screen.queryByTestId('bar-item-offset');\n    const barLegendEl = screen.queryByTestId('bar-item-legend');\n\n    expect(barItemEl).toHaveClass('is-negative');\n    expect(barMainEl).toHaveStyle({ height: barPercentage });\n    expect(barOffsetEl).toHaveStyle({ height: risePercentage });\n    expect(barLegendEl).toHaveTextContent(legend);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nSave your changes and let's see the result of our tests in the terminal.\n\n![Screenshot of complete test coverage for BarItem component](/images/posts/how-to-create-your-own-bar-graph-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/bar-item-component-test-coverage-complete.png)\n\nAwesome! We're done with the tests for our `BarItem` component. Let's move on to the next component.\n\n---\n\n## Write tests for BarGraph component\n\nSame as what we did for the `BarItem` component, let's first add the `data-testid` attribute in our `BarGraph` component to help us query the elements in the component later. Querying an element, checking its attributes and content is the most common way to test a component. Open `src/components/BarGraph.tsx` and update the code with the following:\n\n```tsx\n...\nexport default function BarGraph({ dataArray }: Props) {\n  ...\n  return (\n    <div className=\"bar-graph\">\n      <div className=\"bars-list\">\n        ...\n      </div>\n      <div\n        ...\n        data-testid=\"bars-line\"\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nYou might ask why we didn't need to add the `data-testid` attribute for the `bars-list` element. That's because we can query for the `bar-item` elements using their `data-testid` we already added earlier and use the `.queryAllByTestId()` function to return an array of elements instead of one element.\n\nNow it's time to write tests for the `BarGraph` component. Create the test file with the following path `src/components/__tests__/BarGraph.test.tsx` and add the initial code:\n\n```tsx\nimport { render } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport BarGraph, { Props } from '../BarGraph';\n\ndescribe('<BarGraph />', () => {\n  const renderComponent = (props: Props) => render(<BarGraph {...props} />);\n});\n```\n\n---\n\nAlright. What should be our first test case? We can actually use the three graphs we used to help us handle all the scenarios for our bar graph component. To help you recall, here was the screenshot from [Part 1](/posts/how-to-create-your-own-bar-graph-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests-part-1):\n\n![Screenshot of different bar graphs built in React and TypeScript](/images/posts/how-to-create-your-own-bar-graph-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/bar-graphs-1.png)\n\nStarting from the left of the image or screenshot, the first graph displays a bar graph with all positive values, the line bar is at the bottom and one of the bars with the highest value occupies 100% of the graph height. The second graph displays a bar graph with one negative value, notice how the line bar elevates the **_same level_** as the bars with positive values. You could also say that the height of the bar with negative value is the **_same level_** as the line bar's elevation level. The third graph displays a bar graph with all negative values, aside from the line bar elevating, bars with smaller negative values also elevate until it sticks to the line bar.\n\nSo let's start with the first graph with all positive values. We won't be using `faker` to generate the values in the `dataArray` because in order to verify the random values, we need to also generate the expected results or percentages of them and we'll probably end up copying the code from the main file and that will make the test file complicated and difficult to understand. Hence, it would be better to hardcode the values along with the expected result array.\n\nLet's use the same `dataArray` we have from the `App` component for our first test case. Here's the additional code for our first test case in `src/components/__tests__/BarGraph.test.tsx`:\n\n```tsx\n...\nimport { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';\n\ndescribe('<BarGraph />', () => {\n  const renderComponent = (props: Props) => render(<BarGraph {...props} />);\n\n  it('should convert positives values to percentages', () => {\n    const expectedPercentages = ['29%', '43%', '100%', '71%'];\n    const dataArray = [\n      {\n        value: 200,\n        legend: faker.lorem.sentence(),\n      },\n      {\n        value: 300,\n        legend: faker.lorem.sentence(),\n      },\n      {\n        value: 700,\n        legend: faker.lorem.sentence(),\n      },\n      {\n        value: 500,\n        legend: faker.lorem.sentence(),\n      },\n    ];\n\n    renderComponent({ dataArray });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n---\n\nYou might be wondering how I get the hardcoded values for the `expectedPercentages`. I got it by using the inspect element feature of the browser I'm using. You can inspect the elements to view the HTML of our React app and you will be able to see the controlled style properties such as `height` and `bottom`. Here's [an article](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-inspect) on how to use the inspect element feature in [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_sg/chrome/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/sg/safari/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/).\n\n![Screenshot of using inspect element on a bar graph built in React and TypeScript](/images/posts/how-to-create-your-own-bar-graph-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/bar-graph-inspect-element.png)\n\nI have stored the expected percentages in an array called `expectedPercentages` to make our checks efficient later when looping through the `dataArray` and match their [indexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering) with the items from the `dataArray`. For the legend props, we still use `faker` to generate the text because it is straightforward to verify by just comparing the element's content to it.\n\nAlright, we're all set to check our rendered component and verify whether each bar has the expected percentage. We need to query all of the `bar-item-main` elements from our rendered component. Here's the code for that:\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarGraph />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should convert positives values to percentages', () => {\n    ...\n\n    renderComponent({ dataArray });\n\n    const barPercentageItems = screen.queryAllByTestId('bar-item-main');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nAs for our first check, let's check that the array length for `barPercentageItems` is the same as the length of our `dataArray`:\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarGraph />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should convert positives values to percentages', () => {\n    ...\n\n    const barPercentageItems = screen.queryAllByTestId('bar-item-main');\n\n    expect(barPercentageItems).toHaveLength(dataArray.length);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n---\n\nSave the change and let's see if this passes by looking at our terminal:\n\n![Screenshot of incomplete test coverage for BarGraph component](/images/posts/how-to-create-your-own-bar-graph-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/bar-graph-component-test-coverage-incomplete-1.png)\n\nAwesome, it passed! You can also see how useful having the test coverage information is because it will tell you which lines of the main file have not been covered yet. We should be able to cover that line in the next test cases but we're not done with our first test case yet. We still need to loop through the `bar-item-main` elements or the `barPercentageItems` and verify that their percentage or [`height`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height) CSS property is what we expect it to be. Here's the code for that:\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarGraph />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should convert positives values to percentages', () => {\n    ...\n    expect(barPercentageItems).toHaveLength(dataArray.length);\n\n    barPercentageItems.forEach((element, idx) => {\n      expect(element).toHaveStyle({\n        height: expectedPercentage[idx],\n      });\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nDon't forget to save your changes. Now take a look at our terminal to see if it also passes:\n\n![Screenshot of incomplete test coverage for BarGraph component](/images/posts/how-to-create-your-own-bar-graph-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/bar-graph-component-test-coverage-incomplete-2.png)\n\nAnd yes it still does.\n\nIn the same test case, we also need to check whether the elevation for each bar is what we expect it to be. Because all of them are in positive values, we expect the elevation or the height CSS property of each `bar-item-offset` element to be `0%`. We can query for the `bar-item-offset` elements the same way we did for the `bar-item-main` elements. Let's update the code with the following below:\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarGraph />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should convert positives values to percentages', () => {\n    ...\n    const barPercentageItems = screen.queryAllByTestId('bar-item-main');\n    const barOffsetItems = screen.queryAllByTestId('bar-item-offset');\n\n    expect(barPercentageItems).toHaveLength(dataArray.length);\n    expect(barOffsetItems).toHaveLength(dataArray.length);\n\n    barPercentageItems.forEach((element, idx) => {\n      expect(element).toHaveStyle({\n        height: expectedPercentage[idx],\n      });\n    });\n\n    barOffsetItems.forEach((element) => {\n      expect(element).toHaveStyle({ height: '0%' });\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n---\n\nAlright. When we save our changes, this is what we should see from the terminal:\n\n![Screenshot of incomplete test coverage for BarGraph component](/images/posts/how-to-create-your-own-bar-graph-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/bar-graph-component-test-coverage-incomplete-3.png)\n\nWe can optimize our test case by just doing one loop and here's the refactored code:\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarGraph />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should convert positives values to percentages', () => {\n    ...\n    const barPercentageItems = screen.queryAllByTestId('bar-item-main');\n    const barOffsetItems = screen.queryAllByTestId('bar-item-offset');\n\n    expect(barPercentageItems).toHaveLength(dataArray.length);\n    expect(barOffsetItems).toHaveLength(dataArray.length);\n\n    barPercentageItems.forEach((element, idx) => {\n      expect(element).toHaveStyle({\n        height: expectedPercentages[idx],\n      });\n      expect(barOffsetItems[idx]).toHaveStyle({ height: '0%' });\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nSave the following changes above and the test case should still pass.\n\n---\n\nIn the same test case again, we need to check that the legends are displayed accordingly. We can query for the `bar-item-legends` elements and get the expected legend for each bar from the `dataArray` using the array index. Let's update the code with the following below to verify that:\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarGraph />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should convert positives values to percentages', () => {\n    ...\n    const barPercentageItems = screen.queryAllByTestId('bar-item-main');\n    const barOffsetItems = screen.queryAllByTestId('bar-item-offset');\n    const barLegendItems = screen.queryAllByTestId('bar-item-legend');\n\n    expect(barPercentageItems).toHaveLength(dataArray.length);\n    expect(barOffsetItems).toHaveLength(dataArray.length);\n    expect(barLegendItems).toHaveLength(dataArray.length);\n\n    barPercentageItems.forEach((element, idx) => {\n      expect(element).toHaveStyle({\n        height: expectedPercentages[idx],\n      });\n      expect(barOffsetItems[idx]).toHaveStyle({ height: '0%' });\n      expect(barLegendItems[idx]).toHaveTextContent(dataArray[idx].legend);\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nAfter saving the changes, the test case will still pass as expected.\n\nOkay. Finally, to complete our first test case for the `BarGraph` component, let's also check whether the `bars-line` element elevation or the [`bottom`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/bottom) CSS property of it is what we expect. Since the values for the bar graph are all positive values, we expected it to be at the very bottom or the value of the bottom CSS property is `0%`. Let's update the code to include this check:\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarGraph />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should convert positives values to percentages', () => {\n    ...\n    barPercentageItems.forEach((element, idx) => {\n      ...\n    });\n\n    const barsLine = screen.queryByTestId('bars-line');\n\n    expect(barsLine).toHaveStyle({ bottom: '0%' });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nAnd this should pass after saving the changes.\n\n---\n\nLet's move on to the second test case where we handle the second graph from the reference screenshot. Our `dataArray` will have one negative value. Let's copy the `dataArray` from the `App` component again and here's the initial code for our second test case in `src/components/__tests__/BarGraph.test.tsx`:\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarGraph />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should convert positives values to percentages', () => {\n    ...\n  });\n\n  it('should convert positive values and one negative value to percentages', () => {\n    const expectedPercentages = ['56%', '33%', '22%', '78%'];\n    const expectedOffsets = ['22%', '22%', '0%', '22%'];\n    const expectedBarsLine = '22%';\n    const dataArray = [\n      {\n        value: 500,\n        legend: faker.lorem.sentence(),\n      },\n      {\n        value: 300,\n        legend: faker.lorem.sentence(),\n      },\n      {\n        value: -200,\n        legend: faker.lorem.sentence(),\n      },\n      {\n        value: 700,\n        legend: faker.lorem.sentence(),\n      },\n    ];\n\n    renderComponent({ dataArray });\n  });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nOkay, I've added the expected percentages and offsets. As a challenge for yourself, you can try to complete the code to verify our second test case using the first test case as your reference.\n\n---\n\nOnce you're done, you can take a look at the expected code of the second test case below:\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarGraph />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should convert positive values and one negative value to percentages', () => {\n    ...\n\n    renderComponent({ dataArray });\n\n    const barPercentageItems = screen.queryAllByTestId('bar-item-main');\n    const barOffsetItems = screen.queryAllByTestId('bar-item-offset');\n    const barLegendItems = screen.queryAllByTestId('bar-item-legend');\n\n    expect(barPercentageItems).toHaveLength(dataArray.length);\n    expect(barOffsetItems).toHaveLength(dataArray.length);\n\n    barPercentageItems.forEach((element, idx) => {\n      expect(element).toHaveStyle({\n        height: expectedPercentages[idx],\n      });\n      expect(barOffsetItems[idx]).toHaveStyle({ height: expectedOffsets[idx] });\n      expect(barLegendItems[idx]).toHaveTextContent(dataArray[idx].legend);\n    });\n\n    const barsLine = screen.queryByTestId('bars-line');\n\n    expect(barsLine).toHaveStyle({ bottom: expectedBarsLine });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nWas your code similar to the code above? If yes, then great! If not, no worries. Just keep practicing as we all know, practice makes perfect.\n\n---\n\nOnce you save the changes, our second test case should pass:\n\n![Screenshot of complete test coverage for BarGraph component](/images/posts/how-to-create-your-own-bar-graph-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/bar-graph-component-test-coverage-complete-1.png)\n\nIn the screenshot above, we've already reached `100%` test coverage. You might want to stop here, but just to make sure our `BarGraph` component can handle if all the values are negative, we should create a test case for that as well.\n\nHere's the code for the final test case which is just very similar from our second test case:\n\n```tsx\n...\ndescribe('<BarGraph />', () => {\n  ...\n  it('should convert negatives values to percentages', () => {\n    const expectedPercentages = ['21%', '43%', '100%', '71%'];\n    const expectedOffsets = ['79%', '57%', '0%', '29%'];\n    const expectedBarsLine = '100%';\n    const dataArray = [\n      {\n        value: -150,\n        legend: faker.lorem.sentence(),\n      },\n      {\n        value: -300,\n        legend: faker.lorem.sentence(),\n      },\n      {\n        value: -700,\n        legend: faker.lorem.sentence(),\n      },\n      {\n        value: -500,\n        legend: faker.lorem.sentence(),\n      },\n    ];\n\n    renderComponent({ dataArray });\n\n    const barPercentageItems = screen.queryAllByTestId('bar-item-main');\n    const barOffsetItems = screen.queryAllByTestId('bar-item-offset');\n    const barLegendItems = screen.queryAllByTestId('bar-item-legend');\n\n    expect(barPercentageItems).toHaveLength(dataArray.length);\n    expect(barOffsetItems).toHaveLength(dataArray.length);\n\n    barPercentageItems.forEach((element, idx) => {\n      expect(element).toHaveStyle({\n        height: expectedPercentages[idx],\n      });\n      expect(barOffsetItems[idx]).toHaveStyle({ height: expectedOffsets[idx] });\n      expect(barLegendItems[idx]).toHaveTextContent(dataArray[idx].legend);\n    });\n\n    const barsLine = screen.queryByTestId('bars-line');\n\n    expect(barsLine).toHaveStyle({ bottom: expectedBarsLine });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n---\n\nDon't forget to save the changes and take a look at the final screenshot of our terminal below:\n\n![Screenshot of complete test coverage for BarGraph component](/images/posts/how-to-create-your-own-bar-graph-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/bar-graph-component-test-coverage-complete-2.png)\n\nAlright, we are done! We've managed to write tests with 100% test coverage for our newly created bar graph component that can handle positive and negative values built in React and TypeScript.\n\nI hope you learned a lot from this post.
