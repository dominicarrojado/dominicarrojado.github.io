Check out the guide for `faker` [here](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/).\n\n---\n\n## Write tests for props\n\nFor test files, I like to separate them in a folder so that it's less cluttered when viewing the main files. Create a new folder named `__tests__` under the `src/components`. This is where we will put the test files for the components under `src/components` folder.\n\nSince we are writing tests for `OtpInput` component, create a file under `src/components/__tests__` and name it `OtpInput.test.tsx`. This is a common naming convention for test files, make sure it matches the name of the component you are testing.\n\nThen let's add in the structure of the test:\n\n```tsx\nimport OtpInput, { Props } from '../OtpInput';\n\ndescribe('<OtpInput />', () => {});\n```\n\nAside from importing the component that we will test, we also imported the type `Props`. You'll get to know why we did that later on.\n\n`describe` is one of Jest's global functions, so with the setup of Create React App, we don't need to specifically import these global functions in our code, we can just directly use them. `describe` creates a block that groups together several related tests. So ideally the description should be describing what we are testing, so in this case I used the component name. Feel free to rename it according to your preference.\n\nNext we can add a test case inside the `describe` block:\n\n```tsx\nimport OtpInput, { Props } from '../OtpInput';\n\ndescribe('<OtpInput />', () => {\n  it('should accept value & valueLength props', () => {});\n});\n```\n\nThe `it` (or `test`) method is another global function by Jest that runs a test. This is where we can have different test cases. Let's start to populate our first test case. First you want to do is to create a reusable function `renderComponent` inside the `describe` block, it should accepts the props of our component as an argument and calls the `render()` method from Testing Library to render our component with the passed props in a test environment.\n\n```tsx\nimport { render } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport OtpInput, { Props } from '../OtpInput';\n\ndescribe('<OtpInput />', () => {\n  const renderComponent = (props: Props) => render(<OtpInput {...props} />);\n\n  it('should accept value & valueLength props', () => {});\n});\n```\n\nSince we'll be having multiple test cases for this component, creating a reusable function to render the component will reduce the code duplication. This will also make it easier if ever next time you have to rename your component. Since we can just change it within these lines and not in multiple separate lines.\n\nNow, before we can render our component using the reusable function we need to provide the required props for it. This is where we use `faker` to generate random data for us. We need `digit` only so we can generate a random `number` then convert it into a `string` as `value` prop. It can be from `0` to `999999` which randomly generates a 1-digit code to a 6-digit code. For `valueLength`, we just use the length from the generated `value` prop.\n\nHow about `onChange` prop? We can actually just pass our own simple function but it would be better to create a mock function using `jest.fn()` which we allows us to capture the calls of it amongst other things you could do. To know more about mock functions and what you can do with it, you can read more [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/mock-functions).\n\n---\n\nHere's the following changes to the code:\n\n```tsx\n...\nimport { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';\n\ndescribe('<OtpInput />', () => {\n  ...\n\n  it('should accept value & valueLength props', () => {\n    const value = faker.datatype.number({ min: 0, max: 999999 }).toString();\n    const valueLength = value.length;\n\n    renderComponent({\n      value,\n      valueLength,\n      onChange: jest.fn(),\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nSo after rendering the component, we need to do our checks afterwards. We basically can check that the number of input boxes is the same as the `valueLength`. To query all the input boxes, it is advisable to use `screen` methods from Testing Library, and in our case we can use `.queryAllByRole('textbox')`, which returns an array of elements that have `textbox` as a role. To learn more about queries in Testing Library, you can go [here](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about).\n\n```tsx\n...\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';\n\ndescribe('<OtpInput />', () => {\n  ...\n\n  it('should accept value & valueLength props', () => {\n    ...\n\n    renderComponent({\n      value,\n      valueLength,\n      onChange: jest.fn(),\n    });\n\n    const inputEls = screen.queryAllByRole('textbox');\n  });\n});\n```\n\n---\n\nOkay, now we have an array of input elements. It is now possible to do the checks by executing one of Jest's global functions called the `expect()` method and pass the element or elements returned by the query, and run what we call a matcher method `.toHaveLength()` which checks the length of the array is equal to the argument passed. This is one of matcher methods provided by the `jest` library. While you can check this [documentation](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#custom-matchers) for the custom matcher methods which are specific to the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction).\n\n```tsx\n...\n\ndescribe('<OtpInput />', () => {\n  ...\n\n  it('should accept value & valueLength props', () => {\n    ...\n\n    renderComponent({\n      value,\n      valueLength,\n      onChange: jest.fn(),\n    });\n\n    const inputEls = screen.queryAllByRole('textbox');\n\n    expect(inputEls).toHaveLength(valueLength);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nAnd we just wrote our first test case! Save your changes and let's verify if this test case did pass or not. In your terminal, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nyarn test --coverage\n```\n\nThe `--coverage` parameter will show you which how many percentage you have covered in each files of your project and/or if you have missed any line to test. Once the command ran successfully, the terminal should display something like this:\n\n![Screenshot of React OTP Input incomplete test coverage](/images/posts/how-to-create-your-own-otp-input-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/test-coverage-incomplete-1.png)\n\nIt did pass! So in the first test case, we can actually do another check to make it more robust and trustworthy. Remember we passed the `value` prop which contains a string of random digits? We can actually check that the input boxes contain each digit per box based on their position in the string. In this case, we can convert the generated `value` string into an array. Then loop through the input elements array which gives us access to the individual input element along with its index `idx`, then check from the `valueArray` array using the `idx` if it is the same value inside the input element. To check the input element value in the `expect()` method, we can use the custom matcher method `.toHaveValue()`. With this understanding, update the code with the following below:\n\n```tsx\n...\n\ndescribe('<OtpInput />', () => {\n  ...\n\n  it('should accept value & valueLength props', () => {\n    const value = faker.datatype.number({ min: 0, max: 999999 }).toString();\n    const valueArray = value.split('');\n    const valueLength = value.length;\n\n    ...\n\n    expect(inputEls).toHaveLength(valueLength);\n\n    inputEls.forEach((inputEl, idx) => {\n      expect(inputEl).toHaveValue(valueArray[idx]);\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nAnd, our first test should still passed. Let's move on to the next test case.\n\n---\n\n## Write tests to allow typing of digits\n\nNext test case would be to check when we type digits it should trigger the `onChange` function from the props and also focus on the next input element. If there's no next input element, the focus should remain on the current element.\n\nWe can use the `fireEvent` method which is also from Testing Library to trigger DOM events in the test environment. To fire other DOM events, you can check out the [documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-events/). First argument it accepts is the element you want the event to get fired to while optionally, you can pass a second argument to provide event data or details related to the event such as `target` object which is what we'll be doing.\n\nHere's the code for the second test case:\n\n```tsx\nimport { fireEvent, render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';\n...\n\ndescribe('<OtpInput />', () => {\n  ...\n\n  it('should allow typing of digits', () => {\n    const valueLength = faker.datatype.number({ min: 2, max: 6 }); // random number from 2-6 (minimum 2 so it can focus on the next input)\n    const onChange = jest.fn();\n\n    renderComponent({\n      valueLength,\n      onChange,\n      value: '', // keep the value prop empty to trigger the change event\n    });\n\n    const inputEls = screen.queryAllByRole('textbox');\n\n    expect(inputEls).toHaveLength(valueLength);\n\n    inputEls.forEach((inputEl, idx) => {\n      const digit = faker.datatype.number({ min: 0, max: 9 }).toString(); // random number from 0-9, typing of digits is 1 by 1\n\n      // trigger a change event\n      fireEvent.change(inputEl, {\n        target: { value: digit }, // pass it as the target.value in the event data\n      });\n\n      // custom matcher to check that \"onChange\" function was called with the same digit\n      expect(onChange).toBeCalledTimes(1);\n      expect(onChange).toBeCalledWith(digit);\n\n      // custom matcher to check that the focus is on the next input\n      // OR\n      // focus is on the current input if next input doesn't exist\n      const inputFocused = inputEls[idx + 1] || inputEl;\n\n      expect(inputFocused).toHaveFocus();\n\n      onChange.mockReset(); // resets the call times for the next iteration of the loop\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nI hope the comments helped in explaning the new codes.\n\nAlright, save the changes above and check your terminal, the coverage now should look like this:\n\n![Screenshot of React OTP Input incomplete test coverage](/images/posts/how-to-create-your-own-otp-input-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/test-coverage-incomplete-2.png)\n\n---\n\n## Write tests to not allow typing of non-digits\n\nAlright, now since we allow typing of digits in the input boxes, we should also check that we are not allowing typing of non-digits in the input boxes. The code for this test case would look similar to our previous test case with minor changes, here it is:\n\n```tsx\n...\n\ndescribe('<OtpInput />', () => {\n  ...\n\n  it('should NOT allow typing of non-digits', () => {\n    const valueLength = faker.datatype.number({ min: 2, max: 6 });\n    const onChange = jest.fn();\n\n    renderComponent({\n      valueLength,\n      onChange,\n      value: '',\n    });\n\n    const inputEls = screen.queryAllByRole('textbox');\n\n    expect(inputEls).toHaveLength(valueLength);\n\n    inputEls.forEach((inputEl) => {\n      const nonDigit = faker.random.alpha(1);\n\n      fireEvent.change(inputEl, {\n        target: { value: nonDigit },\n      });\n\n      expect(onChange).not.toBeCalled();\n\n      onChange.mockReset();\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nAs you can see here, we generated a random alphabet character and use that as the value on the change event. `onChange` mock function shouldn't be called because we are not supposed to do anything if the text is not a digit.\n\nSave your changes and let's verify this test case:\n\n![Screenshot of React OTP Input incomplete test coverage](/images/posts/how-to-create-your-own-otp-input-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/test-coverage-incomplete-3.png)\n\nAnd the test case passes. Great!\n\n---\n\n## Write tests to allow deleting of digits (focus on previous element)\n\nNow it's time to write tests when we're deleting digits from the input boxes. The logic there is that when we delete the digit from an input box, it will be replaced with a sapce `' '` to keep the position of the digits in other input boxes. Also if a key down event was triggered with the input value already empty, it should focus to the previous element. Let's also ensure that there are values in the input boxes so that it can trigger the change event for deletion. This might be a little tough to write but here's the code for this test case:\n\n```tsx\n...\n\ndescribe('<OtpInput />', () => {\n  ...\n\n  it('should allow deleting of digits (focus on previous element)', () => {\n    const value = faker.datatype.number({ min: 10, max: 999999 }).toString(); // minimum 2-digit so it can focus on the previous input\n    const valueLength = value.length;\n    const lastIdx = valueLength - 1;\n    const onChange = jest.fn();\n\n    renderComponent({\n      value,\n      valueLength,\n      onChange,\n    });\n\n    const inputEls = screen.queryAllByRole('textbox');\n\n    expect(inputEls).toHaveLength(valueLength);\n\n    for (let idx = lastIdx; idx > -1; idx--) { // loop backwards to simulate the focus on the previous input\n      const inputEl = inputEls[idx];\n      const target = { value: '' };\n\n      // trigger both change and keydown event\n      fireEvent.change(inputEl, { target });\n      fireEvent.keyDown(inputEl, {\n        target,\n        key: 'Backspace',\n      });\n\n      const valueArray = value.split('');\n\n      valueArray[idx] = ' '; // the deleted digit is expected to be replaced with a space in the string\n\n      const expectedValue = valueArray.join('');\n\n      expect(onChange).toBeCalledTimes(1);\n      expect(onChange).toBeCalledWith(expectedValue);\n\n      // custom matcher to check that the focus is on the previous input\n      // OR\n      // focus is on the current input if previous input doesn't exist\n      const inputFocused = inputEls[idx - 1] || inputEl;\n\n      expect(inputFocused).toHaveFocus();\n\n      onChange.mockReset();\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\nOnce the changes are saved, let's check the terminal and see what's displayed now:\n\n![Screenshot of React OTP Input incomplete test coverage](/images/posts/how-to-create-your-own-otp-input-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/test-coverage-incomplete-4.png)\n\nAwesome, it still `PASS` and the uncovered lines are getting lesser. Let's keep it going ~\n\n---\n\n## Write tests to allow deleting of digits (do not focus on previous element)\n\nSo this test case is kind of a duplicate of the above with minor changes to cover line `99` of `OtpInput.tsx`. When the deletion happens but the input element wasn't previously empty, we should not focus on the previous element. Here's the test case for that:\n\n```tsx\n...\n\ndescribe('<OtpInput />', () => {\n  ...\n\n  it('should allow deleting of digits (do NOT focus on previous element)', () => {\n    const value = faker.datatype.number({ min: 10, max: 999999 }).toString();\n    const valueArray = value.split('');\n    const valueLength = value.length;\n    const lastIdx = valueLength - 1;\n    const onChange = jest.fn();\n\n    renderComponent({\n      value,\n      valueLength,\n      onChange,\n    });\n\n    const inputEls = screen.queryAllByRole('textbox');\n\n    expect(inputEls).toHaveLength(valueLength);\n\n    for (let idx = lastIdx; idx > 0; idx--) { // idx > 0, because there's no previous input in index 0\n      const inputEl = inputEls[idx];\n\n      fireEvent.keyDown(inputEl, {\n        key: 'Backspace',\n        target: { value: valueArray[idx] },\n      });\n\n      const prevInputEl = inputEls[idx - 1];\n\n      expect(prevInputEl).not.toHaveFocus();\n\n      onChange.mockReset();\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\nSince our previous test case already checks the `onChange` logic during deletion, here we just have to check that the previous element was not in focus when we trigger a keydown event with a key of `Backspace` and the `target` during the event had a `value`.\n\nAlright, once you save the changes, and check the terminal, line `99` is removed from the uncovered lines. Sweet!\n\n---\n\n## Write tests to allow pasting of digits\n\nOkay, this test case should be easy enough for you to try out. I hope after learning how to write a couple of test cases above, you now have the knowledge and confidence to do this on your own. So first, before you start writing the code. Let's understand what's the logic for handling the paste event. So the paste event handling exists in the change event, it checks whether the `target.value` is a digit and also has the same length as the `valueLength`, we need to provide a digit that's more than one in length so that it is considered a paste event and not just a normal typing of a single digit. Do keep the `value` passed in the props as empty since we are pasting the value in the change event. Since we allow pasting in any of the elements, you can either loop through all the input elements and trigger the change event, or you can even just choose a random input element to paste on which I think is good enough. Now after you triggered the change event with the `target.value` containing the copied digits. You should check that the `onChange` mock function was called with the same `digits` in the change event. As we are doing a `.blur()` in the paste event, it is good to check that the input element does not have the focus.\n\nAlright, I gave you the hints, try it out yourself!\n\nOnce you're done, compare it with the changes I did here:\n\n```tsx\n...\n\ndescribe('<OtpInput />', () => {\n  ...\n\n  it('should allow pasting of digits (same length as valueLength)', () => {\n    const value = faker.datatype.number({ min: 10, max: 999999 }).toString(); // minimum 2-digit so it is considered as a paste event\n    const valueLength = value.length;\n    const onChange = jest.fn();\n\n    renderComponent({\n      valueLength,\n      onChange,\n      value: '', // keep the value prop empty to trigger the change event for paste\n    });\n\n    const inputEls = screen.queryAllByRole('textbox');\n\n    // get a random input element from the input elements to paste the digits on\n    const randomIdx = faker.datatype.number({ min: 0, max: valueLength - 1 });\n    const randomInputEl = inputEls[randomIdx];\n\n    fireEvent.change(randomInputEl, { target: { value } });\n\n    expect(onChange).toBeCalledTimes(1);\n    expect(onChange).toBeCalledWith(value);\n\n    expect(randomInputEl).not.toHaveFocus();\n  });\n});\n```\n\nOkay if my changes are relatively the same as yours, then give yourself pat in the back!\n\nThe test coverage should look like this now:\n\n![Screenshot of React OTP Input incomplete test coverage](/images/posts/how-to-create-your-own-otp-input-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/test-coverage-incomplete-5.png)\n\nSince we're doing an `if` and `else if` conditions in the `inputOnChange` function in the `OtpInput.tsx`, line `72` will eventually be considered as uncovered lines because the `else` condition is not handled in our test cases yet. It may not show up now until you add the rest of the other test cases. So before that happens, let's just cover that now with the following code:\n\n```tsx\nimport { fireEvent, render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';\nimport OtpInput, { Props } from '../OtpInput';\n\ndescribe('<OtpInput />', () => {\n  ...\n\n  it('should NOT allow pasting of digits (less than valueLength)', () => {\n    const value = faker.datatype.number({ min: 10, max: 99999 }).toString(); // random 2-5 digit code (less than \"valueLength\")\n    const valueLength = faker.datatype.number({ min: 6, max: 10 }); // random number from 6-10\n    const onChange = jest.fn();\n\n    renderComponent({\n      valueLength,\n      onChange,\n      value: '',\n    });\n\n    const inputEls = screen.queryAllByRole('textbox');\n    const randomIdx = faker.datatype.number({ min: 0, max: valueLength - 1 });\n    const randomInputEl = inputEls[randomIdx];\n\n    fireEvent.change(randomInputEl, { target: { value } });\n\n    expect(onChange).not.toBeCalled();\n  });\n});\n```\n\nOnce you save the changes, this test case should pass as well.\n\n---\n\n## Write tests for handling arrow keys\n\nAnd for our last test case, we should cover the keydown events with arrow keys. This was implemented to improve the accessibility of our input boxes. Just a recap, if we press the right or down arrow keys on the keyboard, the focus should be on the next input element. And if we press the left or up arrow keys on the keyboard, the focus should be on the previous input element. These are all handled by the keydown event handler.\n\nLet's first cover the right and down arrow keys. Here's the test case for that:\n\n```tsx\n...\n\ndescribe('<OtpInput />', () => {\n  ...\n\n  it('should focus to next element on right/down key', () => {\n    renderComponent({\n      value: '',\n      valueLength: 3,\n      onChange: jest.fn(),\n    });\n\n    const inputEls = screen.queryAllByRole('textbox');\n    const firstInputEl = inputEls[0];\n\n    fireEvent.keyDown(firstInputEl, { key: 'ArrowRight' });\n\n    const secondInputEl = inputEls[1];\n\n    expect(secondInputEl).toHaveFocus();\n\n    fireEvent.keyDown(secondInputEl, { key: 'ArrowDown' });\n\n    const thirdInputEl = inputEls[2];\n\n    expect(thirdInputEl).toHaveFocus();\n  });\n});\n```\n\nHere I did it manually so that it is easier to understand. First I triggered a keydown event with a key of `ArrowRight` to the first input element then checked that the second input element has the focus. Then I triggered another keydown event with a key of `ArrowDown` to the second input element then checked that the third input element has the focus.\n\nNow by just merely changing the variables and the keys, you can cover the left and up arrow keys. Try it yourself!\n\n---\n\nOnce you're done, check that the changes you did are about the same as mine:\n\n```tsx\n...\n\ndescribe('<OtpInput />', () => {\n  ...\n\n  it('should focus to next element on left/up key', () => {\n    renderComponent({\n      value: '',\n      valueLength: 3,\n      onChange: jest.fn(),\n    });\n\n    const inputEls = screen.queryAllByRole('textbox');\n    const thirdInputEl = inputEls[2];\n\n    fireEvent.keyDown(thirdInputEl, { key: 'ArrowLeft' });\n\n    const secondInputEl = inputEls[1];\n\n    expect(secondInputEl).toHaveFocus();\n\n    fireEvent.keyDown(secondInputEl, { key: 'ArrowUp' });\n\n    const firstInputEl = inputEls[0];\n\n    expect(firstInputEl).toHaveFocus();\n  });\n});\n```\n\nDon't forget to save your changes before you check the terminal:\n\n![Screenshot of React OTP Input complete test coverage](/images/posts/how-to-create-your-own-otp-input-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/test-coverage-complete.png)\n\nWow, all green which means we have 100% test coverage. That's very satisfying to see, ain't it?\n\nWe have completed writing tests for our React OTP Input component. Well done for reaching to this point ~\n\nThat's it! You've just built your own OTP input in React and TypeScript and also learned how to write tests for it using Jest and Testing Library. I hope you've learned a lot from this post, especially if you're new to TypeScript and Jest. The OTP input we have just built is reusable and provides great user experience while keeping in mind the best practices when implementing an OTP input. You can customize the `valueLength` prop to meet your requirements, be it a 4-PIN code, 5-digit pass code or 6-digit one-time code. As I mentioned earlier, there's tons of OTP input boxes I've seen out there but some of them don't give a great user experience like this, so please share to your network, colleagues or anyone you think might find this post helpful and let's make OTP input boxes great again!\n\nIn case you need the final code of the OTP input component as a reference, here's the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dominicarrojado/react-typescript-otp-input).\n\nI'll be writing more of posts about \"building your own components in React and TypeScript with tests\" so stay stuned and come back again to my blog to check out what's new.\n\nCheers ~\n\n## Online references\n\n- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)\n- [SMS OTP form best practices](https://web.dev/sms-otp-form/)\n","previousPost":{"id":"how-to-create-your-own-otp-input-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests-part-1","title":"How to create your own OTP input in React and TypeScript with tests (Part 1)","date":"2022-06-16","excerpt":"Learn how to build a modern OTP input component in a reactive and reusable way","category":"technology","videoUrl":"https://youtu.be/Qpo4gUfv2Fs"},"nextPost":{"id":"local-development-setup-for-nextjs-typescript-and-tailwindcss-projects","title":"Local development setup for Next.js projects with TypeScript and TailwindCSS","date":"2022-07-20","excerpt":"A quick way to get started with the React framework for production","category":"technology","videoUrl":"https://youtu.be/2Zb93oc0068"},"title":"How to create your own OTP input in React and TypeScript with tests (Part 2)","date":"2022-06-16","excerpt":"Learn how to build a modern OTP input component in a reactive and reusable way","category":"technology","videoUrl":"https://youtu.be/s6MFjcCen2A"}},"__N_SSG":true}
