Not often do you find an engineer with an eye for design details, and Dominic happens to be one of them. I enjoyed working with him on some projects with complex UI (User Interface) design. Whenever he delivers, it's always a joy to see my design comes alive as I intended. Any designer would be lucky to have Dominic working on his/her design.
