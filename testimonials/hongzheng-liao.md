It is every manager's dream to have an engineer like Dominic in the team. He is self-driven, confident, proactive and smart. He has brought great value to the team by consistently building and delivering software solutions in time and with great quality. He would always be an indispensable asset to any team he works for in the future and has my highest recommendation.
