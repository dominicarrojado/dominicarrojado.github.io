          I'm Dominic Arrojado and my passion is turning design into code. I'm a
          web developer specializing in both front-end &amp; back-end
          development. I'm experienced in developing small to large web
          applications.

          I'm originally from the Philippines and found an opportunity to move
          here in Singapore to be with my girlfriend (now fianc√©e!) and further
          my career. I've been here since 2018 and my knowledge and experiences
          have grown exponentially since then. With Singapore being a
          multi-ethnic society and a regional hub, I'm able to work with
          competitive people from different walks of life; gave me the
          inspiration and challenges I needed that shaped me to who I am today.

          When I'm not coding, I'm either watching{' '}

          Being an introvert and a man of few words, I didn't imagine myself to
          be doing this tech blog, but one day I suddenly had the urge to start
          writing{' '}

            <a>tech blogs</a>

            videos
          </AnchorLink>{' '}
          to share my knowledge and learnings in my web development experiences
          - so I'm going to see where this goes and hopefully it will benefit
          and help some of you folks out here!

        <p>That's all for me for now. Thanks for reading ~</p>
